# SFCityExplorer
SF City Explorer is a personal, educational project built to learn data visualization and interactive mapping using real-world urban data from San Francisco.

The project brings together multiple public datasets into a single interactive map to help users explore neighborhoods and access useful city information such as parking rules, street cleaning schedules, and public facilities.

✨ Features

The interactive map allows users to explore:

🏘️ Neighborhood boundaries
🚗 Time-limited parking zones
🧹 Street cleaning schedules
🅿️ Garages and parking lots
🎬 Film locations
🚻 Public restrooms
🚰 Water fountains
🚲 Bicycle parking locations

Each dataset is displayed as a separate layer, making it easy to toggle information on and off.

🎯 Purpose

This project was created to:
Learn geospatial data visualization
Practice working with real city datasets
Understand map layers, filtering, and user interaction
Build a practical project for a personal portfolio

It is not an official city service and is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.
